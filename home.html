                    my professional history begins from O level 2017 till A level 2019 where 
                    I was able to excel with flying colors. This was just the beginning;
                    I have also volunteered in different organizations where I have
                    expanded on skills such as public speaking,leadership,team work, problem 
                    solving among others.
                    Over the years, I have taught myself different  design tools such as 
                    Photoshop and Figma.This therefore defines my love for graphic design
                    in addition to web and app development.

                    This year 2024, came with a huge blessing of Ground Breaker Talents scholarship.
                    While at the campus of Ground Breaker, with partnership of Refactory academy,
                    I am learning a lot of interestng things including website development using Wordpress and 
                    HTML, CSS to design websites. In addition new knowledge about UI/UX design,
                    communication skills, among others. And soon learn programming languages such as Pyhton,
                    JavaScript to mention but a few.

                </p>

            <div class="Future">
                <h2>Future aspirations</h2>
                <p
                    style=" border: solid 2px brown; padding: 30px; margin: 15px; text-align: justify; border-radius: 10px;">
                   I hope that in the near future, I will be able to design a personal website and 
                   create for others too. 
                   Additionally, to be able to impact  the world with the new
                   set of skills from programming languages such as Python and JavaScript, to create
                   real life solutions. 
                   I would like to impact positively to disadvantaged people,especially ladies with
                   life changing skills such as website development and graphic design. I beleive
                   that through increased support for women in tech, we can change the narrative
                   against women lagging behind in the tech industry.
